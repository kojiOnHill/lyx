# These fail because of the following warning:
#
#   lyx2lyx warning: Can't find bibfiles for bibtex inset at line <N>!
#
# From Jürgen (https://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=mid&q=f6dad5b0596f33e6931ffa4ea4ca49390b5c1bf8.camel%40lyx.org):
#   The bibtex inset in these files does not contain any bib file, so the
#   warning is appropriate. I would not want to ditch the warning, as it
#   makes sense to warn in this case.
#
#   On the other hand I can see why it makes sense to include an empty
#   inset to a template file.
#
#   So this is probably a case where adjustment to please the tests would
#   be over-optimization.
#
# Alternative to inverting them would be to just always ignore this warning in
# the ctests, but I think it might be useful in other cases.

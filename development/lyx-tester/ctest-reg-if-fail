# %28APA%29,_v._6: not sure why these are failing (the apa6.cls exists) but not worth the time since obsolete.
#
# supported-languages_polyglossia_.*_systemF: The LuaTeX changes started failing at 99299169. I think XeTeX failed before. I need to figure out the Noto fonts thing.
#
# Europe_CV: see here: https://github.com/gsilano/EuropeCV/issues/29
# There is a patch but is not backwards-compatible so it's not clear if
# it will be merged.
#
# BATCH_compare-test: I'm not sure why this fails, but no time to look into it.
#
# BATCH_vcs-info, BATCH_outline-beamer: these tests fail when configure.ac has, e.g., "beta".
#   We know what we need to do to fix this, but just need to do it.

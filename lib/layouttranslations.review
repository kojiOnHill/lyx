The following languages in layouttranslation file are used, yet they haven't
been reviewed by native speaker and we should ask for checking the list any
time (new) translator appears with .po update.

(29.4.2011, LyX 2.0.0 release) 

gl ko sl tr


----
(8.4.2014, LyX 2.1.0 release)

Additionally to the top ones, these languages should be reviewed for the following strings:
"Property"
"Solution"
"Listing"
"Listings"

ro sr

-----
(30.11.2017, LyX 2.3.0 release )
Additionally to the top ones, these languages should be reviewed for the following strings
"List of Listings"
da gl ko nb nn pl ro sl sr tr

"Nomenclature[[output]]" -> The string that is output to PDF for the nomenclature list
"see equation[[nomencl]]"
"page[[nomencl]]"
da gl ko nb nn pl ro sl sr tr

-----
LyX 2.4.0 release

"Notes[[Endnotes]]" -> The header string of endnotes (with "Endnotes (Basic)" and "Footnotes as Endnotes
(Basic)" modules). This is to be distinguished from "Notes" used by the Notes inset (which is more an
annotation than a list of (end)notes)
ar el en hu nb nl nn pl tr
Note that the localized enotez package has the following translations that probably should be used:
Croatian: Bilje\v{s}ke
French: Remarques
Hungarian: Megjegyz\'{e}sek
Turkish: Notlar

new strings (not yet committed) for:
ar: Chart, Graph[[mathematical]], List of Charts, List of Graphs[[mathematical]], Nomenclature[[output]]

-----
LyX 2.5.0 release

Additionally to the top ones, the languages below should be reviewed for the following strings
(which should already be translated for the most part):

Chapter
Part
Section
Paragraph[[Sectioning]]
Footnote

These strings are used in formatted cross references with prettyref.

Furthermore, the following strings are used in formatted cross references to theorems (as in "see assumption 1").

We have references to single theorems within sentences (singular, lowercased in English):

algorithm
assumption
axiom
claim
conclusion
condition
conjecture
corollary
criterion
definition
example
exercise
fact
lemma
notation
note
problem
proposition
question
remark
solution
summary
theorem

The same strings (singular) for sentence begin (uppercased in English) --
these are here for some time and have been reviewed previously in most languages:

Algorithm
Assumption
Axiom
Claim
Conclusion
Condition
Conjecture
Corollary
Criterion
Definition
Example
Exercise
Fact
Lemma
Notation
Note
Problem
Proposition
Question
Remark
Solution
Summary
Theorem

Then we have plural forms for the same strings within sentences (lowercased in English),
as in "criteria 3 and 4":

algorithms
assumptions
axioms
claims
conclusions[[theorem]]
conditions
conjectures
corollaries
criteria
definitions
examples
exercises
facts
lemmas
notations
notes[[theorem]]
problems
propositions
questions
remarks
solutions
summaries
theorems

And, finally, the plural forms for sentence begin (uppercases in English):

Algorithms
Axioms
Claims
Conclusions[[theorem]]
Conditions
Conjectures
Corollaries
Criteria
Definitions
Examples
Exercises
Facts
Lemmas
Notations
Notes[[theorem]]
Problems
Propositions
Questions
Remarks
Solutions
Summaries
Theorems

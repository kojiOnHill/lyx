Public release of LyX version 2.4.4
===================================

We are proud to announce the release LyX 2.4.4, the fourth maintenance
release in the 2.4.x series. We have fixed a number of bugs, including some
crashes, and introduced a few new features.

Here are some highlights.

There have been a number of updates to LyX's interface with computer algebra
systems. See below for details.

LyX now (again) has a function (error-next) and a menu entry (Navigate >
Next Error) to quickly jump to the next compilation error. This re-introduces
a feature we lost 20 years ago with LyX 1.4 (bug 2775)! LyX now also has a
function (errors-show) and a menu entry (Document > Processing Errors) to
(re)open the dialog that lists compilation errors (a.k.a. "LaTeX Errors")
after it has been closed, with the next error at/after cursor highlighted.

One important fix concerns the generation of previews. In certain cases,
LaTeX adds a temporary page at the end, and this confuses our python script
that generates previews, making it unable to determine the pages to process
through dvipng. This requires a re-run of LaTeX, which we can easily do. See:
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/689978/why-does-temporary-page-error-occur
A related problem has been solved for dvipng versions >= 1.16. With earlier
versions, dvipng returns with an error code when some previews contain
postscript specials, so that LyX will 'fall back' to the legacy method for
generating all previews instead of only the ones with postscript specials.
These will be of lower quality, and various messages will be output to the
terminal. If this bothers you, please upgrade your version of dvipng.

For complete information on what's new and on bugs that have been fixed, see the list below.

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the
documentation that comes with LyX (under Help) and the LyX wiki, which
you will find at https://wiki.lyx.org/. You can also send email to
the LyX users' list (lyx-users at lists.lyx.org). Bugs can be reported
on our bug tracker (https://www.lyx.org/trac/) or by writing the
developers' list (lyx-devel at lists.lyx.org).

What's new
==========

** Updates:
***********

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- LyX now includes a layout, template and example for the Springer Nature
  Journal class.

- Support GNOME's paper PDF viewer.

- Implement product for computer algebra systems (bug 13186).


* USER INTERFACE

- LyX includes a new icon set to select from in preferences: Adwaita. This is
  the default GNOME icon set with flat (symbolic) design, completed with some
  LyX-specific icons that match the design. We provide a dark and light mode
  version which will be automatically selected as needed.

- LyX now (again) has a function (error-next) and a menu entry (Navigate >
  Next Error) to quickly jump to the next compilation error.

- LyX now also has a function (errors-show) and a menu entry (Document >
  Processing Errors) to (re)open the dialog that lists compilation errors
  (a.k.a. "LaTeX Errors") after it has been closed, with the next error
  at/after cursor highlighted.

- The grid display in the MathGrid dialog has been visually improved,
  particularly in dark mode (bug 13146).

- The document dialog now opens faster on first launch.

- Use Right/Left or Outer/Inner for page margins, as appropriate (bug 12410).

- Changing zoom values should be now consistently maintained across different
  LyX Windows. It supposedly also fixes a crash when switching between
  documents in different LyX windows on Mac (bug 13162).


* DOCUMENTATION AND LOCALIZATION

- Updated Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese (traditional and simplified),
  Czech, French, German, Japanese, Slovak, and Ukranian localizations.


* BUILD/INSTALLATION

- Update macOS build script to check for more recent SDKs too.


** Bug fixes:
*************

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- Fix crash when attempting to load a corrupted master from a child (bug
  13151).

- Fix crash when adding custom LaTeX argument to multicolumn in varwidth table
  (bug 13158).

- Improve fix for crash when exporting a recursive macro (bug 12633).

- Try to handle differences in how divpng reports certain kinds of errors.

- Fix erroneous whitespace before and after math preview (bug 13127).

- Ask to save unsaved changes before closing document dialog via ESC key or
  cross button (bug 8145).

- Fix Libertinus Math fonts with AMS symbols (bug 13145).

- Japanese default quote style for direct input (not via IME) is changed to
  english.

- Improve detection of removed documents. We did not distinguish between
  rewrite and removal in some cases (bug 12819).

- Fix parsing error with math code when LyX file contains DOS line endings
  (which might happen when importing via tex2lyx on Windows).

- Include local layout files in LyX archive (bug 13149).

- Fix handling of integrals with external computer algebra systems.

- Fix cmidrule trimming in last column of a formal table (bug 13171).

- Use proper minus sign character in MathML export (bug 13067).


* USER INTERFACE

- Fix tiny previews when initially loading a file (bug 13078).

- Fix preview update missing after some operations (bug 13116).

- Fix crash in batch LyX when ui_style is set (bug 13141).

- Rebuild toolbars on runtime mode switch on Linux.

- Fix an assertion when image previews are loaded.

- Do not require the input of year in bibliography item
  dialog with Natbib (Numeric).

- Fix display of accented characters in math (bug 13156).

- Fix cell splitting in cell equations.

- Fix (dark/light) mode setting and run-time switch with Qt >= 6.8
  (bug 13144).

- Fix display of some icons in dialogs in dark mode.

- Fix display of menu buttons in dark mode.

- Fix minor issues with automatic deletion of bibitem insets.

- Correctly check maxima output for syntax errors.

- Extend cooperation with computer algebra systems:
  - Maxima and Octave can now properly prepend commands in front of
    expressions, e.g. you can use math-extern maxima factor
    for factoring the expression in mathed. See LyX Function Manual
    for details of math-extern function (also see bug 13178).
  - Matrix output of Octave can be read again (very old bug 13180).
  - Matrix output of recent Maxima versions is correctly parsed again.
  - Allow using %-notation with Maxima to specify math constants
    such as the imaginary unit (%i) or Euler's number (%e).
  - Improve input to Maxima such that, for example, \pi is always
    translated as "%pi" and not simply as "pi" in some circumstances.


* DOCUMENTATION AND LOCALIZATION

- Fix preview error in UserGuide.


* LYX2LYX

- Fix endless recursion and string detection mismatch in lyx2lyx
  (bug 13168).


* TEX2LYX

- Fix import of enumitem lists with optional argument (bug 13185).

* BUILD/INSTALLATION

- Fix compilation with gcc 15.

- Fix compilation against Qt 6.9.

- Fix detection of necessary APIs to print callstacks.

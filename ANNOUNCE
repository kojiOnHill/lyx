Public release of LyX version 2.4.4
===================================

We are proud to announce the release LyX 2.4.4, the fourth maintenance
release in the 2.4.x series.



One important fix concerns the generation of previews. In certain cases, the dvipng script will throw an error due to its inability to determine the 
number of output pages. This requires a re-run of LaTeX, which we can easily 
do, but detecting this error has proven more difficult than one might expect.
The problem has been solved for dvipng versions >= 1.16. With earlier versions,
LyX will 'fall back' to the legacy method for generating previews. These will 
be of lower quality, and various messages will be output to the terminal. If 
this bothers you, please upgrade your version of dvipng.

You can download LyX 2.4.4 from https://www.lyx.org/Download.

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the
documentation that comes with LyX (under Help) and the LyX wiki, which
you will find at https://wiki.lyx.org/. You can also send email to
the LyX users' list (lyx-users at lists.lyx.org). Bugs can be reported
on our bug tracker (https://www.lyx.org/trac/) or by writing the
developers' list (lyx-devel at lists.lyx.org).

Public release of LyX version 2.4.2
===================================

We are proud to announce the release LyX 2.4.2, the second maintenance
release in the 2.4.x series.

This is almost entirely a bug-fixing release, with no significant new
features. However, some crashes have been fixed, and we have made some
significant improvements to display speed, which will be especially
noticeable on older or slower systems.

There has been a change (as of 2.4.0) in how the option to use vertical
space between paragraphs is handled. Previously, LyX simply modified 
\parskip and \parindent, but this caused various problems (see bug 
#4796). Now, we use the parskip package. As a result, however, and
to ensure there are no changes to old documents, when LyX files from 
2.3.x and earlier are converted to the new format, if they were set to
use vertical space between paragraphs, the lyx2lyx conversion routine
adds 
  % Added by lyx2lyx
  \setlength{\parskip}{\smallskipamount}
  \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
to the preamble and, within LyX itself, resets the text layout to use
indentation (so we do not issue the new code for vertical spacing). The
net effect is that PDFs generated with LaTeX (etc) look right, but in
LyX itself indentation is used. 

This will happen with any document created with 2.3.x or older. It can
also happen with documents created from templates created with 2.3.x 
or older, and even with new documents, if you had previously set them to 
use, by default, vertical space. Templates are just LyX files saved in 
the templates/ folder, and the 'defaults' are simply saved in a
template file, defaults.lyx. Hence, if you want the new behavior, or 
just want the LyX document to look `right', then you will need to make
two changes to the document or template: Remove what lyx2lyx added, and
then set Paragraph Separation to Vertical Space.

  10970).

- Recognize .plt as a GnuPlot extension (bug 11148).

- Restore obvious "G" shortcut for Greyed Out notes.


* MISCELLANEOUS

- Update format of lyxrc.dist templates

- Update templates to use native vertical space method.


* USER INTERFACE

- Show font info in status line again.

- Make scrolling smoother when using selection.

- Show the temporary directory in About LyX dialog.

- Improve document output pane (bug 12902).

- Speedup interactive use by avoiding expensive math macros bookkeeping
  when possible.

- Make -geometry command-line option work on all platforms.

- Fix macOS bug, where XQuartz application would be launched for no
  reason (bug #13086).

- Fix problem with collapsing of outliner (bug 13098).

- Handle linguistic structure trees in ePub and PDF (DocBook) output (bug 12372).

- Improve the way spaces are handled in labels when refstyle is used.


* USER INTERFACE

  modification. Only file deletion will trigger the modification
  flag now (see bug 12819).

- Fix crash when using Save As... with previews enabled (bug 13091).

- Fix crash when attempting to search in selection that contains
  only math.

- Fix crash when copying some math formulas or exporting them to
  DocBook (bug 13069).

- Fix potential crashes when scrolling documents.

- Fix bug where the dialog asking for saving unapplied changes
  on buffer change popped up twice, or sometimes not at all (bug
  12954).

  (bug 13050).

  (tabularx and xltable), as this is not supported by the packages.
  Also fix the disabling mechanism in the table dialog.

  text-only inset (ERT, Listings...).

- Fix display glitches when applying some operations to a selection.


* INTERNALS

- Fix possible crash in undo code after inserting note inset over a
  multi-paragraph selection.

- Fix a Python script, used to preview math expressions, that used a
  module that is removed in Python 3.13.

- Fix case where debug information may report all numbers as hexadecimal.

- Make sure that lyxclient name is initialized properly.


* TEX2LYX

- Fix import of nomenclature entries which contain '%' or '"' characters.

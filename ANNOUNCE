Public release of LyX version 2.4.4
===================================

We are proud to announce the release LyX 2.4.4, the fourth maintenance
release in the 2.4.x series.



One important fix concerns the generation of previews. In certain cases,
LaTeX adds a temporary page at the end, and this confuses our python script
that generates previews, making it unable to determine the pages to process
through dvipng. This requires a re-run of LaTeX, which we can easily do. See:
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/689978/why-does-temporary-page-error-occur
A related problem has been solved for dvipng versions >= 1.16. With earlier
versions, dvipng returns with an error code when some previews contain
postscript specials, so that LyX will 'fall back' to the legacy method for
generating all previews instead of only the ones with postscript specials.
These will be of lower quality, and various messages will be output to the
terminal. If this bothers you, please upgrade your version of dvipng.

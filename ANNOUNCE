Public release of LyX version 2.4.3
===================================

We are proud to announce the release LyX 2.4.3, the third maintenance
release in the 2.4.x series.

This is mostly a bug-fixing release. Most of the bugs are minor, but
there was one significant one (13118) concerning the loading order of
the fancyhdr package that was causing errors in page layout. In terms of
updates, the most significant are that it is not possible to insert
cross-references from the outliner, even to sections that have not yet
been given a label. In that case, the label is automatically created.
There has also been a major update to the Swedish localization.

You can download LyX 2.4.3 from https://www.lyx.org/Download.

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the
documentation that comes with LyX (under Help) and the LyX wiki, which

the LyX users' list (lyx-users at lists.lyx.org). Bugs can be reported
